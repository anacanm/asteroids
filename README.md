Here is a game inspired by the classic arcade game Asteroids! I made it using Processing, a sketchbook software, and all of my code is written in Java.
Processing can be found at https://processing.org/
To run the game run the Asteroids.pde file!
Use the arrow keys to rotate and move, and hit space to shoot missiles :)
Enjoy
